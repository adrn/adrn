### Hey 👋, I'm Adrian (@adrn)

I'm an associate research scientist (ARS) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics), and I study the structure and dynamics of stars and dark matter in our galaxy, the Milky Way 🌌. I do much more 💻 than 🔭!
