### Hey 👋, I'm Adrian (@adrn)

I am an associate research scientist (ARS) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics) where I help lead the Galactic Dynamics group and study the structure and dynamics of stars and dark matter in our galaxy (the Milky Way 🌌). I am also the Assistant Director of Scientific Software at the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/), and am on the [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) Coordination Committee. I do much more 👨🏽‍💻 than 🔭!
